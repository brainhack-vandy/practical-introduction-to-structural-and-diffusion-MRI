## Introduction to Structural and Diffusion MRI

Structural MRI focuses on capturing high-resolution images of the brain's anatomy, providing detailed views of brain structures such as the cortex, white matter, and cerebellum. It's primarily used for identifying physical abnormalities or changes in brain tissue.

Diffusion MRI, on the other hand, maps the diffusion process of molecules, particularly water, in biological tissues. This is crucial for visualizing and understanding the connectivity and integrity of neural pathways, often referred to as white matter tracts. Unlike structural MRI, diffusion MRI offers insights into the functional architecture and fiber pathways of the brain.
